Dental Management System – Adriano Dental Clinic Phase II	Developed a full-featured dental clinic management system with a combination of monolithic and microservices architecture, complete with a centralized SSO login portal and multiple interconnected applications. The platform includes a main portal and modules for Billing, Inventory, Maintenance, and Appointment Scheduling, along with a Public Website and a CMS, each built as separate React applications unified under one portal interface.
Key features include JWT-secured communication between all apps and the API gateway, real-time notifications via SMTP (Mailgun) and SMS (PhilSMS/Semaphore), and an integrated billing module supporting PayMongo online payments and cash transactions. System data is managed through a PostgreSQL database hosted on a self-managed VPS.
Responsibilities & Achievements:
•	Architected and developed the entire system using React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL / pgAdmin4.
•	Designed a hybrid Microservices + Monolithic backend, including a secure API Gateway.
•	Implemented JWT authentication, centralized SSO, and role-based access across all applications.
•	Developed separate apps for the Public Website and CMS, integrated into the unified portal.
•	Built modules for Billing, Inventory, Appointment, Maintenance, Notifications, and User Management.
•	Integrated Mailgun SMTP, PhilSMS/Semaphore SMS API, and PayMongo for online payments.
•	Deployed and managed the system on Hostinger VPS using
Nginx (SSL), PM2, Docker/Docker Compose, Git Bash/Termius, and WinSCP.
•	Set up the PostgreSQL server inside the VPS and managed via pgAdmin v4.
•	Utilized GitHub, GitHub Desktop, Git Bash, and VS Code with GitHub Copilot / LLM agents during development.

(ADC) Adriano Dental Clinic System Phase - I	Developed the first version of the Adriano Dental Clinic System focused on the Public Website and Appointment Scheduling Module. This phase was built entirely without AI assistance, relying solely on manual coding and architecture design. The goal of Phase I was to create a functional online presence for the clinic and establish a digital appointment workflow.
The system was developed mainly using React.js, TypeScript, MUI, react-hook-form, Node.js and PostgreSQL, with the backend hosted in Azure (free tier). Both the Public Website and Admin Application were exposed using VS Code Port Forwarding for remote access.
Responsibilities & Achievements:
•	Designed and built the Public Website and Admin Appointment Application using React.js and TypeScript.
•	Implemented UI components using Material UI (MUI).
•	Created form handling and validation using react-hook-form.
•	Developed RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js.
•	Integrated appointment SMS notifications using Semaphore SMS API.
•	Deployed backend services to Azure App Service (free tier).
•	Hosted PostgreSQL on Azure Database for PostgreSQL (free tier).
•	Managed project source code using GitHub, GitHub Desktop, and Git Bash.
